The PCI DSS 12.3.1 Targeted Risk Analysis Template is designed to help you formally document the reasoning behind your chosen frequencies or approaches for specific security controls - such as how often you patch, review logs, run scans, etc. PCI DSS expects that these decisions are based on risk, not just habit or convenience.

Title: Identifies the purpose of the document (PCI DSS 12.3.1 compliance).
Introductory text: Describes the PCI requirement and the reason for this analysis.
| **Column Name**                           | **What to Put Here**                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Asset(s)**                              | What system, application, or hardware you're evaluating (e.g., "Windows 10 workstations", "Domain Controllers", "QuickBooks Server")                                                      |
| **Threat(s) Being Mitigated**             | What potential attack or failure the PCI control is designed to prevent (e.g., "Ransomware via phishing", "unauthorized remote access", "data loss from unpatched software")              |
| **Likelihood/Impact Factors**             | What makes this threat more or less likely or impactful for your organization (e.g., "old hardware", "high user turnover", "frequent remote work", "missing endpoint protection")         |
| **Risk Analysis Summary & Justification** | Your assessment of the risk and why your chosen process is appropriate. For example: “Weekly patching is sufficient because AV is updated daily and remote access is tightly controlled.” |
| **Defined Frequency or Control**          | What you’ve decided to do, and how often (e.g., “Apply patches monthly”, “Review logs weekly”, “Run vulnerability scans quarterly”)                                                       |
| **Review Date / Notes**                   | When you last reviewed this risk decision and any notes (e.g., “Reviewed May 2025. Next review May 2026 or upon major system change.”)                                                    |

✅ Important Notes for Compliance
Each control in PCI DSS that allows for flexible implementation (e.g., patching frequency, log review cadence) must be justified using a targeted risk analysis like this.

You must review the analysis at least once per year or after significant changes (new systems, new threats, breaches, etc.).

This document does not replace technical controls - it explains the rationale behind their configuration and schedule.
