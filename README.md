# PCI DSS Compliance Form Templates

This repository contains **blank PCI DSS compliance forms** in both Word (`.docx`) and Excel (`.xlsx`) formats, organized by requirement number. These forms are intended as templates for internal use by teams working toward PCI compliance.

> ⚠️ **Do not upload or submit completed forms to this repository.**  
> This repo is for distributing blank templates only.

## 📁 Structure

Forms are organized by PCI DSS section and requirement:
```
Root/
├── 3/
│   ├── 3.2/
│   │   ├── 3.2.1/
│   │   │   ├── 3.2.1.docx  ← Word version of the form
│   │   │   └── 3.2.1.xlsx  ← Excel version of the same form
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
```

Each folder contains **the same form in two formats**:
- **Word (`.docx`)** — for narrative-style responses or printed copies.
- **Excel (`.xlsx`)** — for structured data entry, checklists, or tables.
